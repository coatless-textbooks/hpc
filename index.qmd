# Welcome to HPC {-}

The goal of High Performance Computing on a Cluster with *R* is to inform and distribute various recipes and techniques for performing computational-intensive work on remote computing resources.

## Thanks! {-}

This work made use of the Illinois Campus Cluster, a computing resource that is operated by the [Illinois Campus Cluster Program (ICCP)](https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/) in conjunction with the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)](https://ncsa.illinois.edu) which is supported by funds from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).

Conversations with the ICCP staff has also greatly helped in developing material. In particular, I would like to thank:

-   Weddie Jackson
-   Matthew Long
-   Chit Khin
