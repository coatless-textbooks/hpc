# Cluster Computing {#cluster-computing}

## What is Cluster Computing?

Definition: Cluster

A **cluster** is a *set of computers* that are connected together and share resources as if they were one gigantic computer.

## How Does Cluster Computing WorK?

Definition: Parallel Processing

**Parallel Processing** is the act of carrying out multiple tasks simultaneously to solve a problem. This is accomplished by dividing the problem into independent subparts, which are then solved concurrently.

Definition: Jobs

**Jobs** denote the independent subparts.

## Why use Cluster Computing?

Pros

-   Speeds up simulations by allowing iterations to be run simultaneously.
-   Provides more resources for computations.
    -   e.g. CPU Cores, RAM, Hard Drive Space, and Graphics Cards (GPUs).
-   Nightly snapshots/backups of files.
-   Extends the lifespan of your computer.

Cons

-   Simulations are **not** instantly run.
    -   Need to "queue" for resources.
-   Higher barrier of entry due to knowledge requirements.
-   Poorly handles opening and closing data sets.
-   Adding or updating software is complex.
